;; ## About

;; **Vade Bytes is for builders.**

;; People who are genuinely curious about a variety of topics. Who like to build things and learn by doing. Who are tired of the marketing fluff and performative content that dominates the internet.

;; What you're signing up for:

;; ‚úì **Raw notes, not polished** - You're getting my actual learning process
;; ‚úì **Written for truth, not virality** - No hooks, no growth hacks
;; ‚úì **Messy middle included** - Mistakes, pivots, the stuff everyone hides
;; ‚úì **Fellow traveler, not guru** - I'm figuring this out alongside you
;; ‚úì **When I have something to say** - No forced content calendar

;; I'm not promising a schedule. I'm promising substance.
