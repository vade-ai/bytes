# Introduction to Spaced Repetition Learning

Welcome to Vade Bytes! This post demonstrates our **spaced repetition system**,
inspired by [quantum.country](https://quantum.country)'s mnemonic medium.

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that leverages the psychological spacing
effect: information is better retained when study sessions are spaced out over time,
rather than crammed into a single session.


## How It Works

As you read through posts on Vade Bytes, you'll encounter interactive prompts
that test your understanding of key concepts. These aren't just passive quizzes—
they're an integral part of how the content is designed to be learned.

Let's try one now:


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(sr/prompt
  {:id "sr-definition"
   :question "What is spaced repetition?"
   :answer "Spaced repetition is a learning technique where review sessions are spaced out over increasing intervals of time."
   :explanation "This takes advantage of the spacing effect, where information is better retained when learning is distributed over time."})
```
:::



```{=html}
<div data-sr-prompt="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;sr-definition&quot;,&quot;question&quot;:&quot;What is spaced repetition?&quot;,&quot;answer&quot;:&quot;Spaced repetition is a learning technique where review sessions are spaced out over increasing intervals of time.&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;This takes advantage of the spacing effect, where information is better retained when learning is distributed over time.&quot;}"></div>
```



## The Science Behind It

Research in cognitive psychology has consistently shown that spacing out learning
over time leads to better long-term retention than massed practice (cramming).
The effect was first documented by Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885.

Here's a simple visualization of memory retention over time:


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
^kind/vega-lite
{:data {:values (map (fn [day]
                       {:day day
                        :cramming (* 100 (Math/exp (- (/ day 5.0))))
                        :spaced (+ 50 (* 50 (Math/exp (- (/ day 30.0)))))})
                     (range 0 100 5))}
 :width 600
 :height 300
 :layer [{:mark {:type :line :point false}
          :encoding {:x {:field :day
                         :type :quantitative
                         :title "Days After Learning"}
                     :y {:field :cramming
                         :type :quantitative
                         :title "Retention (%)"
                         :scale {:domain [0 100]}}
                     :color {:value "#ff6b6b"}}}
         {:mark {:type :line :point false}
          :encoding {:x {:field :day :type :quantitative}
                     :y {:field :spaced :type :quantitative}
                     :color {:value "#51cf66"}}}]
 :config {:legend {:orient "bottom"}}}
```
:::



```{=html}
<div><script>vegaEmbed(document.currentScript.parentElement, {"data":{"values":[{"day":0,"cramming":100.0,"spaced":100.0},{"day":5,"cramming":36.787944117144235,"spaced":92.3240862445307},{"day":10,"cramming":13.53352832366127,"spaced":85.82656552868946},{"day":15,"cramming":4.978706836786395,"spaced":80.32653298563167},{"day":20,"cramming":1.8315638888734178,"spaced":75.6708559516296},{"day":25,"cramming":0.6737946999085467,"spaced":71.7299104253539},{"day":30,"cramming":0.24787521766663584,"spaced":68.39397205857212},{"day":35,"cramming":0.09118819655545163,"spaced":65.57016119572988},{"day":40,"cramming":0.033546262790251184,"spaced":63.17985690578634},{"day":45,"cramming":0.012340980408667957,"spaced":61.15650800742149},{"day":50,"cramming":0.0045399929762484845,"spaced":59.443780141878094},{"day":55,"cramming":0.0016701700790245659,"spaced":57.993987303984696},{"day":60,"cramming":6.14421235332821E-4,"spaced":56.766764161830636},{"day":65,"cramming":2.2603294069810544E-4,"spaced":55.727942199634384},{"day":70,"cramming":8.315287191035679E-5,"spaced":54.84859839322025},{"day":75,"cramming":3.059023205018258E-5,"spaced":54.10424993119494},{"day":80,"cramming":1.1253517471925912E-5,"spaced":53.47417256114008},{"day":85,"cramming":4.139937718785167E-6,"spaced":52.940823582121496},{"day":90,"cramming":1.522997974471263E-6,"spaced":52.4893534183932},{"day":95,"cramming":5.602796437537268E-7,"spaced":52.10719217546382}]},"width":600,"height":300,"layer":[{"mark":{"type":"line","point":false},"encoding":{"x":{"field":"day","type":"quantitative","title":"Days After Learning"},"y":{"field":"cramming","type":"quantitative","title":"Retention (%)","scale":{"domain":[0,100]}},"color":{"value":"#ff6b6b"}}},{"mark":{"type":"line","point":false},"encoding":{"x":{"field":"day","type":"quantitative"},"y":{"field":"spaced","type":"quantitative"},"color":{"value":"#51cf66"}}}],"config":{"legend":{"orient":"bottom"}}});</script></div>
```


The red line shows memory decay with cramming, while the green line shows
the more gradual decay (and thus better retention) with spaced repetition.

Let's test your understanding:


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(sr/prompt
  {:id "ebbinghaus-discovery"
   :question "Who first documented the spacing effect in learning?"
   :answer "Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885."
   :explanation "Ebbinghaus conducted pioneering research on memory, including the forgetting curve and the spacing effect."})
```
:::



```{=html}
<div data-sr-prompt="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ebbinghaus-discovery&quot;,&quot;question&quot;:&quot;Who first documented the spacing effect in learning?&quot;,&quot;answer&quot;:&quot;Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885.&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Ebbinghaus conducted pioneering research on memory, including the forgetting curve and the spacing effect.&quot;}"></div>
```



## The SM-2 Algorithm

Our implementation uses a simplified version of the **SM-2 algorithm**,
developed by Piotr Woźniak in 1987 for the SuperMemo software.

The algorithm schedules review based on:
- How many times you've reviewed the item
- How difficult you rated it
- An "ease factor" that adjusts based on your performance

Here's how it works conceptually:


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
^kind/table
{:Review [1 2 3 4]
 :Interval ["1 day" "7 days" "21 days" "~2 months"]
 :Note ["First review" "One week later" "Three weeks later" "Increasing intervals"]}
```
:::


::: {.clay-table}

```{=html}
<table class="table table-hover table-responsive clay-table"><thead><tr><th>Review</th><th>Interval</th><th>Note</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1 day</td><td>First review</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>7 days</td><td>One week later</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>21 days</td><td>Three weeks later</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>~2 months</td><td>Increasing intervals</td></tr></tbody></table>
```

:::


The actual intervals adjust based on whether you rate items as Easy, Medium, or Hard.


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(sr/prompt-group
  {:title "Algorithm Basics"
   :prompts [{:id "sm2-stands-for"
              :question "What does SM-2 stand for?"
              :answer "SuperMemo 2 - the second algorithm developed by Piotr Woźniak for the SuperMemo software."}
             {:id "sm2-factors"
              :question "What three factors does SM-2 use to schedule reviews?"
              :answer "Number of reviews, difficulty rating, and an ease factor that adjusts over time."
              :explanation "The ease factor makes frequently-hard items appear more often, while easy items get longer intervals."}]})
```
:::



```{=html}
<div class="sr-prompt-group"><h4 class="sr-group-title">Algorithm Basics</h4><div data-sr-prompt="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;sm2-stands-for&quot;,&quot;question&quot;:&quot;What does SM-2 stand for?&quot;,&quot;answer&quot;:&quot;SuperMemo 2 - the second algorithm developed by Piotr Wo\u017aniak for the SuperMemo software.&quot;}" key="sm2-stands-for"></div><div data-sr-prompt="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;sm2-factors&quot;,&quot;question&quot;:&quot;What three factors does SM-2 use to schedule reviews?&quot;,&quot;answer&quot;:&quot;Number of reviews, difficulty rating, and an ease factor that adjusts over time.&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The ease factor makes frequently-hard items appear more often, while easy items get longer intervals.&quot;}" key="sm2-factors"></div></div>
```



## How to Use Vade Bytes

1. **Read naturally**: Don't worry about memorizing everything
2. **Answer prompts**: When you see a prompt, try to answer before revealing
3. **Rate difficulty**: After seeing the answer, honestly rate how easy it was
4. **Return regularly**: Come back to review prompts as they come due

Your progress is tracked in the right sidebar under "Your Learning Progress".


## Inline Prompts

Some prompts are smaller and less visually prominent—we call these "inline prompts".
They're useful for quick checks without interrupting the flow too much.


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(sr/inline-prompt
  {:id "inline-example"
   :question "What's the main advantage of inline prompts?"
   :answer "They allow quick knowledge checks without disrupting reading flow as much as full prompts."})
```
:::



```{=html}
<div class="sr-prompt-inline" data-sr-prompt="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;inline-example&quot;,&quot;question&quot;:&quot;What&apos;s the main advantage of inline prompts?&quot;,&quot;answer&quot;:&quot;They allow quick knowledge checks without disrupting reading flow as much as full prompts.&quot;}"></div>
```



## Writing Posts with Spaced Repetition

As a content creator on Vade Bytes, you can embed prompts directly in your
Clojure source files. Here's an example:

```clojure
(require '[vade-bytes.sr :as sr])

(sr/prompt
  {:id \"unique-id-for-tracking\"
   :question \"What is the question you want to ask?\"
   :answer \"The answer to reveal.\"
   :explanation \"Optional: Additional context or explanation.\"})
```

The system handles all the scheduling, progress tracking, and UI automatically!


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(sr/prompt
  {:id "sr-integration"
   :question "How do you add a spaced repetition prompt to a Vade Bytes post?"
   :answer "Use (sr/prompt {:id ... :question ... :answer ...}) in your Clojure source file."
   :explanation "The sr namespace provides helpers that Clay renders as interactive HTML components."})
```
:::



```{=html}
<div data-sr-prompt="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;sr-integration&quot;,&quot;question&quot;:&quot;How do you add a spaced repetition prompt to a Vade Bytes post?&quot;,&quot;answer&quot;:&quot;Use (sr\/prompt {:id ... :question ... :answer ...}) in your Clojure source file.&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The sr namespace provides helpers that Clay renders as interactive HTML components.&quot;}"></div>
```



## Benefits of Learning This Way

Traditional blog posts are "write-only": you read them once and likely forget
most of the content within days. With spaced repetition embedded in the medium
itself, Vade Bytes helps you actually **retain** what you read.

This is especially valuable for technical content where you need to build on
previous knowledge over time.

Let's solidify what you've learned:


::: {.sourceClojure}
```clojure
(sr/prompt-group
  {:title "Review: Key Concepts"
   :prompts [{:id "review-spacing-effect"
              :question "Why does spaced repetition work better than cramming?"
              :answer "The spacing effect: information is better retained when learning is distributed over time rather than massed together."}
             {:id "review-usage"
              :question "What should you do when you see a prompt in a Vade Bytes post?"
              :answer "Try to answer the question yourself, reveal the answer, and honestly rate the difficulty."}
             {:id "review-benefit"
              :question "What's the main advantage of Vade Bytes over traditional blogs?"
              :answer "Content retention - the spaced repetition system helps you actually remember what you read over the long term."}]})
```
:::



```{=html}
<div class="sr-prompt-group"><h4 class="sr-group-title">Review: Key Concepts</h4><div data-sr-prompt="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;review-spacing-effect&quot;,&quot;question&quot;:&quot;Why does spaced repetition work better than cramming?&quot;,&quot;answer&quot;:&quot;The spacing effect: information is better retained when learning is distributed over time rather than massed together.&quot;}" key="review-spacing-effect"></div><div data-sr-prompt="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;review-usage&quot;,&quot;question&quot;:&quot;What should you do when you see a prompt in a Vade Bytes post?&quot;,&quot;answer&quot;:&quot;Try to answer the question yourself, reveal the answer, and honestly rate the difficulty.&quot;}" key="review-usage"></div><div data-sr-prompt="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;review-benefit&quot;,&quot;question&quot;:&quot;What&apos;s the main advantage of Vade Bytes over traditional blogs?&quot;,&quot;answer&quot;:&quot;Content retention - the spaced repetition system helps you actually remember what you read over the long term.&quot;}" key="review-benefit"></div></div>
```



## Next Steps

Now that you understand how the system works, explore other posts and see
how spaced repetition helps you build deep, lasting knowledge in technical topics.

**Pro tip**: Check your learning progress in the right sidebar. As you answer
prompts, you'll see them move through different time intervals. Come back
regularly to review!

Happy learning! 🚀
