Something happened to technical writing.

You used to share what you learned. Write about problems you solved. Document your journey. It felt genuine. You built something real, and shared your journey. It was inspiring.

Then something shifted. Fake MRR screenshots. Engagement bait. People gaming the algorithm instead of building real things.

I wanted to believe people were truthful about the work they were doing. I wanted to trust that everyone was building real things. But except for a rare few, everyone was just chasing get-rich-quick schemes. Selling the dream, not living it.

It took me time to see this clearly.

Today, most tech content is performance art. Not learning, but performing. Written for algorithms, not humans. Every post carefully crafted to hit emotional triggers, create conflict, maximize engagement and grow the following.

Threads that all sound the same because everyone's following the same playbook.

I tried playing this game for five years. And honestly? I sucked at it.

Same five years I was trying to bootstrap a company, by the way.

## Two Kinds of Writing

There are two ways to write: express yourself, or impress someone else.

Writing to impress is exhausting. You're always performing, always calculating. What hook will stop the scroll? Which framework will get shares? What emotion should I trigger? You finish each piece drained, wondering if you said anything real.

Writing to express is different. You're thinking through ideas, working out problems on the page, sharing what genuinely interests you. Even if nobody reads it, you finish energized because you were true to what you wanted to say.

For five years, I tried the first way. Started blogs that died after three posts. Created content calendars I abandoned. Studied all the viral frameworks, learned all the hooks, then froze at my keyboard wondering what would get engagement instead of what I wanted to say.

So I wrote nothing. Or I wrote things that sounded like everyone else because I was trying to sound like everyone else.

**Vade Bytes is me choosing the second way.**

The simple way: build something, learn something, write about it. Repeat.

If I can't be consistent being myself, there's no point being consistent at all.

## Five Years of Building Everything at Once

Let me tell you what those five years actually looked like.

I hired interns in Bangalore with the hopes I could pull off my bootstrapping dreams and build Vade AI, a no-code platform. How hard could it be?

Turns out, really hard.

And doing it while building a house, bringing a newborn into the world, with a team with less real world experience and a depleting bank account?

This is the closest to impossible I've experienced.

You know that advice about focus? About doing one thing really well? Yeah, I wasn't following that advice. I was building roots and trying to grow wings at the same time.

The stress isn't just about the product. It's about carrying everyone's livelihood while your bank account shrinks. It's about debugging production issues after debugging why the baby won't sleep. It's about feeling responsible for your team's rent, your family's future, and your company's survival all at once.

That weight doesn't just slow you down. It crushes your ability to think clearly about what actually matters.

**Here's what I finally understood: you can't build something genuinely novel while in constant survival mode.**

So I made a choice. Keep the dream, change the path.

The moment I decided to find work felt like both relief and defeat. Relief because I could finally breathe. Defeat because I'd spent five years believing that "real founders" push through no matter what.

But here's what that choice actually gave me: mental space. Space to think clearly about what Vade AI should actually be, instead of what would keep the lights on this month. Space to explore ideas without the panic of a shrinking runway. Space to be present for my family instead of constantly divided between guilt and urgency.

I found work that lets me contribute real value while building something ambitious on the side. Not because I gave up, but because I finally understood the difference between persistence and stubbornness.

This isn't retreat. This is the first strategic decision I've made in years that wasn't driven by desperation.

## What You're Getting Here

My public notebook. The unfiltered documentation of building something ambitious while keeping everything else that matters intact.

Not what I think will go viral. Not what the algorithm wants. What I'm genuinely curious about right now.

Here's what you're getting:

- Raw notes from building a no-code platform
- Lessons from five years in the bootstrapping trenches
- Honest talk about what works and what doesn't
- The messy middle that everyone else edits out

No hooks. No growth hacks. No posting schedule. Just substance when I have something worth expressing.

I'm not here to sell you a framework or position myself as a guru. I'm just a builder sharing what I'm learning as I learn it. If it's useful to you, wonderful. If not, no hard feelings.

## Who This Is For

You, if you're tired of performance.

You, if you're curious about AI, no-code platforms, bootstrapping, or just building things that matter while maintaining a real life.

You, if you've ever written something authentic, then deleted it to write something "more engaging" instead.

You, if you're building something ambitious while juggling responsibilities that matter more than any startup ever could.

You, if you're exhausted by content strategy but still want to share your work authentically.

Basically, Vade Bytes is for builders who give a damn about substance over performance.

## Start Where You Are

You don't need permission to write authentically. You don't need a perfect system or a content calendar or a personal brand strategy.

You just need to be honest about what you're building and what you're learning.

If you've been holding back because you're not "successful enough" yet? Write anyway. The messy middle is where the real learning happens. That's the part worth sharing.

If you've been stuck trying to sound like everyone else, stop. Your specific experience, your particular struggles, your unique perspective: that's what someone needs to hear.

If you've been exhausted by the performance, you're not alone. There are more of us choosing substance over strategy than you think. We're just not as loud about it.

The internet doesn't need another guru selling frameworks. It needs more builders sharing what they're actually learning while they're actually building.

So build your thing. Write about it honestly. Share the parts that don't fit the narrative. Document the decisions that matter, not just the ones that sound good.

The people who need what you're learning will find you. And when they do, they'll stay because you were real, not because you were optimized.

That's what I'm doing here. Come along if you want.
