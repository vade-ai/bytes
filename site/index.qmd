I'm tired of viral hooks and empty content.

For five years, I've tried to build distribution as a bootstrapped founder. Started blogs that died after three posts. Created content calendars I abandoned within weeks. The cycle repeated endlessly.

I studied the "experts." Learned their frameworks, their hooks, their strategies. And that's when I learned something uncomfortable: **most tech content is performance art.** Optimized for engagement, not truth. Written for algorithms, not humans.

Every time I sat down to replicate it, I'd freeze. *What will get engagement? What's the hook?* Then I'd write nothing. Or something that felt fake.

**This is my final attempt at finding my own voice.**

Not the voice that gets likes. The voice I actually enjoy using. The voice that shares what I genuinely find interesting.

The workflow for Vade Bytes is dead simple:

**Do shit. Talk about it. Repeat.**

No content calendar. No viral frameworks. No performance art. Just: build something, learn something, write about it.

If I can't be consistent being myself, then there's no point being consistent at all.

## What Vade Bytes Actually Is

This is my public notebook. My learning journal while building [Vade AI](https://vade.ai) and living a fulfilling life.

**What you're signing up for:**

- **Raw notes, not polished** — You're getting my actual learning process
- **Written for truth, not virality** — No hooks, no growth hacks
- **Messy middle included** — Mistakes, pivots, the stuff everyone hides
- **Fellow traveler, not guru** — I'm figuring this out alongside you
- **When I have something to say** — No forced schedule

I'm not promising a schedule. I'm promising substance.

**When I publish, it'll be in one of these areas:**

- **📊 Tech Tides** — Weekly summaries of everything I learned and built
- **🏗️ Architect's Journal** — System design at scale, practical decisions
- **🗄️ Database Deep Dive** — How databases really work under the hood
- **💡 Founder's Journey** — Real patterns from founders who built real companies
- **📚 Research Refined** — Papers distilled into grokkable explanations
- **⚙️ Clojure Chronicles** — Functional programming wisdom and simplicity
- **🔧 Tandem Tinkering** — Electronics and building things with my kind
- **🤖 How To AI** — Practical AI workflows I actually use

**The common thread?** These are things I'm actively exploring while building Vade AI.

## Why I'm Doing This

I'm not going to pretend this is purely altruistic. I have clear goals:

**1. Satisfy My Curiosity**

For four years, I stressed about the next paycheck with a small team. I gave up the team. Found a job that lets me explore while being useful. Now I can build without panic.

**This is me choosing to enjoy the process.**

And doing it in public? That's my accountability mechanism.

**2. Build My Personal Brand**

I believe there's still room for building a brand on genuine curiosity and real experience. This is my bet that authenticity still works.

**3. Create Distribution for Vade AI**

When Vade AI launches, I need people who understand what I'm building. People who've watched me build it in public. Not because I pitched them, but because they've seen my thinking.

## The Restart

For five years, I tried to bootstrap Vade AI with a small team. Office in Bangalore, big dreams. My wife joined, we brought our newborn along.

But the stress of a depleting bank account took its toll. **So I gave up the team.** Not the dream. Just the unsustainable way I was pursuing it.

I found a job that gives me mental space to build Vade AI properly. Without panic. Without the terror of "how do I make payroll?"

**This is my restart with a fresh perspective.**

Vade Bytes is part of that restart. Building my brand authentically. Creating distribution by earning trust through sharing. Actually enjoying the process.

## Join Me
