I was 19 when I built my first circuit at IIT Kanpur's electronics club. A simple 0 to 9 counter. Nothing impressive.

But getting it to work after an evening of troubleshooting? Watching those numbers finally count up? That hooked me completely.

I didn't build it because it was useful or because anyone asked me to. I built it because I couldn't stop thinking about why the display wasn't working right. Because figuring that out felt more alive than anything else I was doing.

That feeling, the pure joy of making something work just because you're curious, that's what I've been chasing for the last 10 years.

Every decision. Every pivot. Every "strategic move." All of it trying to get back to that feeling.

And somewhere along the way, I lost it completely.

## When Building Became Performance

Something shifted in tech. Maybe it happened to me too.

The game became about earning more. If you weren't increasing your salary constantly, you were somehow losing. It wasn't about curiosity anymore. It was raises, appraisal cycles, climbing the ladder.

When I was curious? I didn't have time. When I had time? I was exhausted.

I joined an early stage startup thinking I'd get back to building. Instead, I got the grind. It wasn't building for the sake of building. It was "we need to make money." "Launch this feature by Friday." "The system is down, get it back up."

Even when you wanted to take time to understand, to learn, the pressure drove you to just make the noise stop. Pick the fastest option. Get it done. Move on.

So I started my own company. Surely that would solve it, right?

Wrong.

Now it was constant pressure to make money. Talking to clients, convincing them to hire you for their next project just to keep the lights on. Performance for customers. Performance for hiring developers. Performance for survival.

And somewhere in there, technical writing shifted too. You used to share what you learned. Document your journey. It felt genuine because someone built something real and shared the unfiltered process.

Then something changed. Fake MRR screenshots. Engagement bait. People gaming algorithms instead of building real things.

I wanted to believe people were truthful. But except for a rare few, everyone was just selling the dream, not living it.

And I started performing too. Not because I wanted to, but because I thought I had to.

Don't know the latest framework? You're a loser. Nobody asks why. Nobody talks about tradeoffs. And if you dared to ask? You got booed off, taunted so hard you wouldn't ask again.

It became performance all the way through. And if you weren't performing, you weren't winning.

I tried playing this game for five years. And honestly? I sucked at it.

Same five years I was trying to bootstrap a company, by the way.

## Five Years of Building Everything at Once

Let me tell you what those five years actually looked like.

I hired interns in Bangalore with the hopes I could pull off my bootstrapping dreams and build Vade AI, a no-code platform. How hard could it be?

Turns out, really hard.

And doing it while building a house, bringing a newborn into the world, with a team with less real world experience and a depleting bank account?

This is the closest to impossible I've experienced.

You know that advice about focus? About doing one thing really well? Yeah, I wasn't following that advice. I was building roots and trying to grow wings at the same time.

The stress isn't just about the product. It's about carrying everyone's livelihood while your bank account shrinks. It's about debugging production issues after debugging why the baby won't sleep. It's about feeling responsible for your team's rent, your family's future, and your company's survival all at once.

That weight doesn't just slow you down. It crushes your ability to think clearly about what actually matters.

**Here's what I finally understood: you can't build something genuinely novel while in constant survival mode.**

So I made a choice. Keep the dream, change the path.

The moment I decided to find work felt like both relief and defeat. Relief because I could finally breathe. Defeat because I'd spent five years believing that "real founders" push through no matter what.

But here's what that choice actually gave me: mental space. Space to think clearly about what I actually want to build, instead of what would keep the lights on this month. Space to explore ideas that spark my curiosity without the panic of a shrinking runway. Space to be present for my family instead of constantly divided between guilt and urgency.

I found work that lets me contribute real value and pays well enough that I don't have to worry about money. Not because I gave up, but because I finally understood the difference between persistence and stubbornness.

This is the first strategic decision I've made in years that wasn't driven by desperation.

And something unexpected happened: I finally got back to what I loved about college. The freedom to tinker. To explore ideas just because they're interesting. To learn without the pressure of monetization. To build things because I'm curious, not because they have to work immediately.

**Vade Bytes is the documentation of that curiosity.**

## What This Means

Through all those years of performance culture, I learned what actually matters. Here's what Vade Bytes stands for:

**Curiosity over performance** - Build to understand, not just to monetize or impress.

**Space over speed** - Mental clarity beats constant hustle. You can't think clearly in survival mode.

**Exploration over perfection** - Share the messy process, failed attempts, and what you're figuring out in real-time.

**Questions over frameworks** - Foster genuine curiosity. Reject the guru culture that shames people for asking "why."

**Building over talking** - Document what you're actually making, not what you think will get engagement.
